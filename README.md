# Duck Pond Royale
This is an online fighting game where you play as a Duck to knock other people off the stage.
This is more of a Minimum Viable Product of a game: You can create a nickname, create a lobby or connect to someone else's, and fight for a winner.
The purpose of this project was more about teaching myself Unity and C# and less about actually finishing the game.

## Lessons Learned
- Online functionality added a lot of confusion to the project. I needed to learn Unity before jumping head first into creating an online game with it
- Create the game before the art: I focused too much on how the game looked before actually finishing the game itself.
- Last but not Least, I learned a lot about Unity and C# during this project so, even though it didn't turn out exactly how I wanted, it still gave me experience and was good practice.
